            <p>Hey there! My name is Jo√£o Pedro and I am from Brazil, as I know my first name is hard to say sometimes, you can call me Johny if you want!</p>
            <p><br>I enjoy watching movies, reading always I have some extra time, and playing board and card games, those are my favorite. I'm passionate about sports like basketball and soccer, so can talk about that too. I also like meeting new and different people so I can learn more about them. </p>
            <p><br>Even though I'm From Rio de Janeiro state, and I really have already been at some of the famous landmarks in the city, and visited the best places there, like the temple, I'm not actually from the city of Rio. My mother city is called Barra Mansa, and it's about 2 hours away by car from the capital. It's a small industrial city, full of energy and lovely people. We don't have too many things to do here, but the city is rounded by other bigger cities, like Volta Redonda, where me, my friends and my wonderful grilfriend Mariny like to go and have some entertainment.</p>
            <p><br>Another interesting thing is that I was born in church, and MY parens always supported my decision to dedicate myself to school and improving myself. I don't come from a very rich family, so I'm really glad for being here and being able of talking about myself. <br> The main reason I decided to take the web development course is that when I was a kid, my oldest causin (who also comes from a poor family) studied a technology related course and works in this carreer nowadays, he could change his and his family's life, and that's what I want to do too.</p>
            <p><br> <br> My favorite temples are:</p>

            <p>One of the most famous brazilian cities, Rio de Janeiro (or just Rio) is famous for it's natural beauties, like famous beaches, mountains and forests mixed with one of the most populous cities in the country. Also, the city is the home of one of one of the 7 wonders of the world, the huge Christ The Redeemer, with its arms wide open look af all the city.
